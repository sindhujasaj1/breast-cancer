Developed a deep learning model leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect breast cancer from histopathological images. The system was trained on a publicly available dataset, focusing on classifying malignant and benign cells with high accuracy. Techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning were utilized to improve performance. This project aims to assist medical professionals in early and precise cancer diagnosis, reducing manual efforts and improving patient outcomes.
